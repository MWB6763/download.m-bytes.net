# m-bytes-website
Actually just another way of downloading M-BYTES versions/products on the internet for 0 valid reasons. ;) [coming soon but will really release when v1.0 comes out seen as public :) ]
Sorry, but this website is actually not ready yet so please be patient.
# But why? &#128547; Come on! &#128545; Tell me, tell me, true!
Because M-BYTES 1.0 isn't finished yet &#128532; and is still private, gotta be honest...
# &#128580; I see, just this nonsense drama!
Hey, don't roll your eyes at me! Just rude!
So when I finish the product's first version I'll change this to a real downloading website so don't give me that look!
# &#128518; YOIII! &#128540; &#128541; &#129299; &#129315; &#129322;
Don't get too crazy! Anyways, have a nice day, readers!
# &#128565; Getting dizzy!
Okay byeee! And last thing, have a fun things like the kool kids do!
